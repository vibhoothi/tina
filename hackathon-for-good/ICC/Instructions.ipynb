    "The envisaged outcome of the challenge is a proof of concept/working prototype of an application mining entities and relationships from txt / HTML / doc(x) documents and outputting them into a graphical database format â€“ such as a .json file or a .csv file featuring a list of edges and nodes of the graph.\n",
    "The OTP fully recognizes that Relationship Extraction is a non-trivial problem. Therefore, the prototype is not expected to have a high degree of accuracy. What the OTP is mostly interested in are proposed approaches, workflows, methods and algorithms for the problem at hand."
